# SQL Project

At this project we explored and executed the different stages to build a solid and structured database.

The SQL declarations can be seen on the folder **Anexos**.

Lastly, the .NET project at **ClubeVideo** shows a dummy implementation of a application that consumes the database built with SQL DDL (DDL files at **Anexos**).
